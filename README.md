#### Challenge 2

    Python has an in-built function – type() to check the data type.
    Example: How to use the function type() to check the data type of the number 3368.5:
        1.At the Python prompt, enter type(3368.5).
        2.Press Enter. The interpreter will return the text, which means 3368.5 is a float object.
    
    Problem Statement

    Now, it’s your turn. Verify the data type for each of the objects given below using the type() function:
    1.55.50
    2.6+4j
    3."hello"
    4.([1,2,3,4])
    5.((1,2,3,4))
    6.({1:"one", 2:"two", 3:"three"})

#### Challenge 4
    Write a short program to help a customer.

    What does the customer want?
    A power bank which has a charging capacity of at least 10000 mAh and costs less than Rs. 3500.

    What does the store have?
    A power bank which is 20000 mAh costing Rs. 3400

    Your Challenge

    Write a program which compares the store's power bank with customer requirements and displays a suitable message.

    Display, 'Yes, this power bank is for you!' if both the requirements are met.
    Display 'No, this doesn't suit your needs.' if either condition is not met.
    If you want, experiment with different values of capacity and cost to see if your code works for both situations.
    
    Note: - Using comparison and logical operators
