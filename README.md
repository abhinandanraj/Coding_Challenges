#### Challenge 2

    Python has an in-built function – type() to check the data type.
    Example: How to use the function type() to check the data type of the number 3368.5:
        1.At the Python prompt, enter type(3368.5).
        2.Press Enter. The interpreter will return the text, which means 3368.5 is a float object.
    
    Problem Statement
    Now, it’s your turn. Verify the data type for each of the objects given below using the type() function:
    1.55.50
    2.6+4j
    3."hello"
    4.([1,2,3,4])
    5.((1,2,3,4))
    6.({1:"one", 2:"two", 3:"three"})

#### Challenge 4
    Write a short program to help a customer.

    What does the customer want?
    A power bank which has a charging capacity of at least 10000 mAh and costs less than Rs. 3500.

    What does the store have?
    A power bank which is 20000 mAh costing Rs. 3400

    Your Challenge

    Write a program which compares the store's power bank with customer requirements and displays a suitable message.

    Display, 'Yes, this power bank is for you!' if both the requirements are met.
    Display 'No, this doesn't suit your needs.' if either condition is not met.
    If you want, experiment with different values of capacity and cost to see if your code works for both situations.
    
    Note: - Using comparison and logical operators

#### Challenge 8
    Help Pi write a function!

    Pi is in a dilemma. He needs to borrow money from his sister but doesn't want to tell her exactly how much he needs.
    Pi: "Hey sis. You're looking cool today!"
    Sis:"What's up Pi…what do you want?"
    Pi: "Umm, actually I am running short of cash…I need to pay my EMI and…"
    Sis: "Yeah…yeah…how much?"
    Pi: "Your wish sis…wait, let me write a function which can help you decide…"
    Sis: "You and your programming! Make it quick."

    Function Details
    Pi wants anything between 7000 and 10000 rupees! 
    So help Pi write a function that will check whether the amount his sister offers to give him (variable, sis) is within the required range of rupees.
    If the number less than 7000, show the message, "Ahem, can you rethink this number please?".
    If the number is greater than 10000, show the message, "Wow sis! You are a queen".
    If the number is within the range, show the message, "Cool, thanks sis! x rupees will certainly help."

    Note: After you have written the required function, keep changing the value of the variable sis to check if your function works for different values.
