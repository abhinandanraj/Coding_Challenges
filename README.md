#### Challenge 2

    Python has an in-built function – type() to check the data type.
    Example: How to use the function type() to check the data type of the number 3368.5:
        1.At the Python prompt, enter type(3368.5).
        2.Press Enter. The interpreter will return the text, which means 3368.5 is a float object.
    
    Problem Statement
    Now, it’s your turn. Verify the data type for each of the objects given below using the type() function:
    1.55.50
    2.6+4j
    3."hello"
    4.([1,2,3,4])
    5.((1,2,3,4))
    6.({1:"one", 2:"two", 3:"three"})

#### Challenge 4
    Write a short program to help a customer.

    What does the customer want?
    A power bank which has a charging capacity of at least 10000 mAh and costs less than Rs. 3500.

    What does the store have?
    A power bank which is 20000 mAh costing Rs. 3400

    Your Challenge

    Write a program which compares the store's power bank with customer requirements and displays a suitable message.

    Display, 'Yes, this power bank is for you!' if both the requirements are met.
    Display 'No, this doesn't suit your needs.' if either condition is not met.
    If you want, experiment with different values of capacity and cost to see if your code works for both situations.
    
    Note: - Using comparison and logical operators

    Pi wants anything between 7000 and 10000 rupees! 
    So help Pi write a function that will check whether the amount his sister offers to give him (variable, sis) is within the required range of rupees.
    If the number less than 7000, show the message, "Ahem, can you rethink this number please?".
    If the number is greater than 10000, show the message, "Wow sis! You are a queen".
    If the number is within the range, show the message, "Cool, thanks sis! x rupees will certainly help."

    Note: After you have written the required function, keep changing the value of the variable sis to check if your function works for different values.

#### Challenge 19
     Program Details
     Suppose you have an input string S with the letters A B C D in any sequence, 
     and another input string T which is to be matched inside S. 
     Near matches are also allowed - where one non-matching character is allowed in identifying a match.

#### Challenge 21
     Program Details
     A pizza shop makes vegan pizzas as well as meat based pizzas. The customers place N orders at the shop and their order number gets printed on thier bill.
     The shop displays K out of N both - vegan and meat based pizza orders on thier display screen at a single time.The pizza shop is very famous and receives many orders. 
     So to avoid confusion, the vegan pizza orders are displayed as a positive order number and the meat based pizza orders are displayed as a negative order number.
     All the orders are delivered in the order in which they are displayed on the screen.Each time a displayed order is ready, it is then removed from the display screen and 
     the next order is added to the display at the end.
     
     A couple has come to eat pizza with their child Billy. Billy is a very naughty child and to keep him busy, 
     his parents tell him to make a list of the first meat nased pizza order number present in each set of K orders displayed on the shop's display scrren.
     
     Write an algorithm to help Billy make a list of the first meat based pizza order numbers displayed on the screen each time an order is delivered to a customer.
     
     Input:
     The first line of the input consists of two space-separated integers - numofOrders and size, representing the total number of orders placed (N) and the number
     of orders displayed on the screen (K), respectively.
     The second line consists of N space-separated integers representing the vegan pizza and meat based pizza order numbers of the orders placed by the customers.
     
     Output:
     Print a list of space-separated integers representing the first meat based pizza order of every K orders displayed on the screen each time an order is
     delivered to a customer and print 0 it the screen does not display any meat based pizza order.
     
     Constraints:
     0 <= numofOrders <= 10^6
     0 <= size <= numofOrders
     -10^9 <= ordersNum <= 10^9; where orderNum represents the order numbers of the orders placed.
     
     Example:
     Input:
     6,3
     -11 -2 19 37 64 -18
     Output:
     -11 -2 0 -18
     
     Explanation:
     Step 1: At the time of the first display, the order numbers displayed are [-11,-2,19].
             So, the first displayed meat based pizza order number is -11.
     Step 2: At the time of the next display, the order numbers displayed are [-2,19,37].
             So, the first displayed meat based pizza order number is -2.
     Step 3: At the time of the next display, the order numbers displayed are [19,37,64].
             Since no meat based pizza order is displayed, the output is 0.
     Step 4: Similarly, at the time of the next display, the order numbers displayed are [37,64,-18].
             So, the first displayed meat based pizza order number is -18.
     So, the output is [-11,-2,0,-18].
